This was the shitty project.

With the shitty manager.

The shitty attitude.

And I don’t know what else. There was absoloutely nothing redeeming about this project at all.

Got the data on week 8.

Wasn’t able to talk to my manager.

Got stuck in random politics

Wasn’t allowed to change teams.

Wasn’t encouraged on the ideas I had.

Wasn’t given direction to go with my new ideas.

Wasn’t given a direct manager as my point of contact.

Wasn’t given feedback in any way.

And all the blame was put on me for it.

I had an absoloutely shitty experience and I would hate for anyone to have to go through that in the workplace.

And being blamed for not escalating it. I should have fucking escalated that shit. I should have lit his ass on fire.
