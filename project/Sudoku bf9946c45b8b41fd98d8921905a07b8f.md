It started off in spite towards Baba. 

I wanted to show that I could do java and I just didnâ€™t like it.

So I created a sudoku solver. It could take any sudoku puzzle and solve it as long as there was at least one tile where only one number was possible.

Later this was upgraded to guess which number would be on a tile and then backtrack to that point later if it realized that it was impossible for that number to be there.

Then it eliminated that number from that position and guessed the next number.

Also I coded this entire thing on notepad, with no versioning.

Then after everything worked I tried to clean up and delete the comments. But then it stopped working and I got so frustrated i stopped working on it completely.
