Created a solution to capture the logo of a company from images of the products.

I used a system that captured all the ‚Äúkeypoints‚Äù from an image and matched keypoints from another image. This project was initially designed for picking out key landmarks from photos of their images on the internet.

I created a tool to create a collage of Logos dynamically. And compare this collage of logos any product to identify which logo it most strongly correlated with.

1. It compared the logos matching relative to each other. 
2. It considered it matched if it matched with one with significantly more confidence than the others. 
3. And case if it didn‚Äôt match with any one or matched with everything to roughly the same degree, then it considered it a new Brand Logo.
4. It then cropped out the logo from the region with the region with the most key points.

Maurice evaluated this project to be worth some hundreds of thousands of dollars if pitched correctly. Sometime in Sensight Labs

Crazy Project, we can apply deep learning to this and generate an accurate list of logos, along with the years from the image names, we can also get their names from chatgpt or whereever and basically create a near-pristene computer vision dataset of logos.

From there we can implement whatever. or show it off to the world with a crazy autologo transformer.

Is this sellable? Like really really sellable?
