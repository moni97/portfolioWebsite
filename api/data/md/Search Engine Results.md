This program searches different search engines (Google and Bing) and uses different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer). Searches for phrases and counts the number of “.com” URLs that show up before the Client’s URL.

This simply uses pip to install the required packages before the program runs, in case it is running on a new system that doesn’t have the required packages.
