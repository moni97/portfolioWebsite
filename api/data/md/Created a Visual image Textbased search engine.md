From the images captured I created a system that uses it well.

Like properly guesses based on probabilities and stuff.

I really really should have used a bayesian network here. Holy fuck.

It calculated the word and had each word mapped to each product.

And the probabilities of the products match up then itâ€™s good, no need for anything else.

Is what I implemented.
