We wanted to digitize data from nutrition labels.

And the job of extracting the bounding boxes was being done by someone else.

But linking the boxes together was the hard part.

And thatâ€™s what we were struggling to do.

So Maurice gave me the job of generating random boxes that would be aligned like nutrition labels.

And he would develop the neural network to take them as inputs.

I got to generate tons of data for this one.
