Created a program to manipulate xlsx files.
The one made earlier was hard coded just for a specific situation where one would take a column and compare them with the other column from the other file, find match and update the original file.
This was further enhanced and parameterized. It took parameters from the console. The parameters were the file names and the column names. This made it completely free of hard coding and could work on any xlsx.
